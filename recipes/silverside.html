    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A lot of people don't seem to like silverside - or corned beef, where it's known in my part of the world. Something something something boiled meat, I think. I love it. Salty and yummy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Silverside</li>
        <li>Frozen mixed veggies</li>
        <li>Packet bechemel sauce <small>(<em>not really, I do make my own, I just don't want to write all that code in here right now</em>)</small></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse off meat</li>
        <li>Put in a pot of water, cover, and bring to the boil</li>
        <li>Empty the pot of water and add fresh water</li>
        <li>Bring to the boil again. Let simmer</li>
        <li>Boil for 1 hour per kilo of meat (so, 1.5 hours for 1.5kg)</li>
        <li>Once cooked, let sit for 15 minutes in the water before transferring to a plate</li>
        <li>Cut thinly once cooled enough. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
